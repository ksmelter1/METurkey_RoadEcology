Abstract:
Animals adjust their space use patterns in response to landscape features, making it essential for wildlife managers to understand potential barriers that may constrain or prevent movement. 
However, wildlife-habitat relationships are often context-dependent, with habitat selection influenced by a variety of abiotic and biotic factors. 
Recognizing this, we investigated how roads influenced female wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris; hereafter turkey) seasonal habitat selection in Maine USA as a function of road type,
time of day, and land cover type to discern how turkeys may select for roads based on different contexts. Since previous research has demonstrated that wildlife can display variable selection patterns
in response to different road types, we assessed differences in selection between primary roads (state roads and highways) and secondary roads (local/township roads). When modeling baseline differences
in seasonal habitat selection patterns, we found that turkeys generally selected for areas closer to secondary roads aside from the fall months, which encapsulated Maine’s fall turkey harvest season.
Further, turkeys selected for areas farther from primary roads during winter and spring movements. When modelling differences in selection of roads across time of day and season, we found that turkeys 
generally selected locations closer to secondary roads during the morning hours. This was apparent during the summer months, where turkeys selected locations closer to primary and secondary roads in the
morning hours aligning with human travel commutes. When modeling the effect of land cover type on seasonal habitat selection relative to hardwood forest, we found that turkeys selected locations further 
from primary and secondary roads in developed landscapes across seasons. However, relative to hardwood forest, turkeys selected locations closer to primary roads near conifer forest cover during winter. 
Our findings have implications for understanding the temporal risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions and suggest that factors such as season, time of day, and the surrounding landscape context of roads 
influence habitat selection, warranting consideration when evaluating the ecological effects of roads.
